# Front-end Engineer
### Palo Alto, CA

## Quick Summary
We are a small design-driven team, focused on impeccable user experience. Simplicity, quality, and care inform our decisions and processes. We believe in a collaborative, feedback-rich design process, and feel that great experiences can only come from teams who care deeply. This is the company we’ve always wanted to exist. 

## Job Description
You’re a product-obsessed front-end engineer who evaluates all of your work through the lens of user experience. You’ve created a number of fully-formed software products that have been released into the wild and maintained. You have an eye for detail and a love for crafting highly-polished user interfaces with delightful micro-interactions. Your design skills are well-rounded, with experience working at all levels of design – product, interaction, and visual. You know what makes great typography, and how it should be applied. 
Because the range of projects is diverse, we need a front-end engineer with experience working on a wide variety of projects – building custom UI components, implementing responsive interfaces, or working to improve the responsiveness and performance of our application. You’ll work directly with designers to create new customer-facing features, from idea, through prototype, to release and maintenance.

## Qualifications
+ Our front-end is built with CoffeeScript, SASS and HAML. As such, you should have a deep understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript. You should also have experience working with front-end Javascript frameworks, especially React.js. You should know how to structure maintainable CSS for large projects.
+ HTTP is the conduit between our front-end and back-end, and as a front-end engineer you should have a thorough understanding of this layer of the stack. This includes deep knowledge of cookies, caching, AJAX, cross-domain sharing, security issues, etc.
+ Our backend runs on Rails with MySQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch on AWS. You should have experience building interfaces for complex applications that are powered by Rails.
+ We write automated tests for all of our code. You should be passionate about testing since you know it’s the only way to deliver high quality software.
